# Production Video Playback Fix

## Issue
Videos don't autoplay in production deployment due to browser autoplay restrictions. Browsers block autoplay without user interaction to prevent unwanted audio/video.

## Root Cause
- Browser autoplay policies require user interaction before allowing video/audio playback
- Production environments are stricter than development previews
- Videos with audio (even if muted initially) are blocked more aggressively

## Solution Implemented

### 1. User Interaction Handler
- Added click-to-enable overlay on all video pages
- First user click enables all video functionality
- Graceful fallback when autoplay is blocked

### 2. Safe Video Play Methods
- `onLoadedData` handlers try to play videos with error handling
- Mouse hover triggers additional play attempts
- Silent error handling prevents console spam

### 3. Production-Ready Video Attributes
```jsx
<video
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  controls={false}
  preload="metadata"
  onLoadedData={(e) => {
    e.currentTarget.play().catch(() => {
      // Autoplay blocked, will play on user interaction
    });
  }}
>
```

### 4. Enhanced Hover Interactions
```jsx
onMouseEnter={() => {
  if (videoRef.current) {
    videoRef.current.muted = false;
    videoRef.current.play().catch(() => {
      // Play failed, video continues as muted
    });
  }
}}
```

## Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/social-content.tsx` - Added user interaction overlay
- `client/src/pages/our-work.tsx` - Updated video refs and play handling
- `client/src/pages/brand-films.tsx` - Enhanced hover interactions
- `client/src/components/hero-section.tsx` - Safe autoplay handling
- `client/src/hooks/use-video-interaction.ts` - Reusable interaction hook

## Testing in Production
1. Videos show poster frame when autoplay is blocked
2. User click enables all video functionality
3. Hover interactions work reliably after initial interaction
4. No console errors from failed autoplay attempts

## Expected Behavior
- Initial load: User sees click-to-enable overlay
- After click: Videos autoplay silently
- On hover: Videos unmute and continue playing
- Mobile compatible: playsInline attribute prevents fullscreen
