# Video Deployment Solution

## Issue
Videos work perfectly in development but fail on production deployment with 500 errors and "MEDIA_ELEMENT_ERROR: Format error".

## Root Cause
The production build process creates a `dist/public` directory for the frontend, but video files remain in the root `public` directory. The production static file serving looks for files in `dist/public` but videos are in `public`.

## Current Status
- Videos work in development (localhost:5000) ✓
- Videos fail on deployment (entaview-cinema-info6953.replit.app) ✗

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual Copy (Immediate Fix)
Before deployment, manually copy video files to the correct location:

```bash
# Run this before deployment
mkdir -p dist/public
cp public/*.mp4 dist/public/
```

### Option 2: Build Process Fix (Recommended)
The build script in package.json should be updated to:

```json
"build": "vite build && mkdir -p dist/public && cp public/*.mp4 dist/public/ && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
```

### Option 3: Alternative Approach
Move all video files to the client/public directory so they get included in the Vite build process automatically.

## Files That Need Video Access
- `/brand-films` - MAKU showreel video
- `/content-partnership` - All 6 videos in horizontal scroll
- `/our-work` - Portfolio videos
- `/` (homepage) - Hero video

## Video Files That Must Be Available
- `hero-video.mp4` (23MB)
- `icon-heist-video.mp4` (61MB)
- `2025 Showreel MAKU (1)_1749340063718.mp4` (40MB)
- `Teremana UK Launch - (Full Version - 4K)_1749341946737.mp4` (41MB)
- `Padel Website (Wide - FINAL) _1749158053418.mp4` (23MB)
- `rezzil-player.mp4` (100MB)
- `Rezzil 16-9 PSVR Final_1749337960289.mp4` (100MB)

## Current Server Configuration
The server/index.ts already has proper MIME type handling for video files:

```javascript
app.use(express.static("public", {
  setHeaders: (res, path) => {
    if (path.endsWith('.mp4')) {
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'video/mp4');
      res.setHeader('Accept-Ranges', 'bytes');
      res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=31536000');
    }
  }
}));
```

## Deployment Steps
1. Ensure video files are in the correct location for production
2. Test video playback on deployment URL
3. Verify all pages load videos correctly
4. Check console for any remaining errors

## Status
- Server configuration: ✓ Complete
- Video utility functions: ✓ Complete
- Development playback: ✓ Working
- Production file copying: ✓ Complete
- Production deployment: ❌ Still failing with 500 errors

## Analysis of Current Issue
The error screenshots show that the deployment URL `entaview-cinema-info6953.replit.app` is returning 500 (Internal Server Error) for video files, while the development preview works perfectly. This suggests:

1. ✓ Videos are correctly copied to `dist/public/`
2. ✓ Server configuration has proper MIME types
3. ✓ Development environment serves videos correctly
4. ❌ Production deployment has different static file serving

## Current File Status
All video files are successfully copied to production directory:
- ✓ Hero video (23MB) - `/hero-video.mp4`
- ✓ MAKU video (39MB) - `/2025 Showreel MAKU (1)_1749340063718.mp4`
- ✓ Icon video (59MB) - `/icon-heist-video.mp4`
- ✓ Padel video (23MB) - `/Padel Website (Wide - FINAL) _1749158053418.mp4`
- ✓ Rezzil videos (100MB each)
- ✓ Teremana video (41MB)

## Deployment Solution
The issue is that Replit's production deployment environment handles static files differently than the development environment. To fix this:

1. **Ensure build includes video files**: Run `./deploy.sh` before deployment
2. **Verify static file serving**: Check that `dist/public/` contains all video files
3. **Test production locally**: Use `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js` to test
4. **Deploy with proper configuration**: Ensure Replit deployment uses correct static file paths

## Next Steps
1. Run the deployment script: `./deploy.sh`
2. Test production build locally
3. Deploy to Replit with video files in correct location
4. Verify deployment URL serves videos correctly
